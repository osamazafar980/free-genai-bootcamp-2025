    Merhaba! (Hello!) Let's start learning Turkish.
        Vocabulary Table
        Turkish	English
        ayı	bear
        kapı	door
        çöp	garbage
        bırakmak	to leave
        dışarı	out
        görmek	to see
        Sentence Structure
        Sentence 1: Subject + Verb + Location (Bears are at the door)
        Bears (subject)
        be (verb)
        door (location)
        Sentence 2: Question Word + Verb + Object + Location (Did you leave the garbage out?)
        You (subject)
        leave (verb)
        garbage (object)
        out (location)
        Clues and Considerations
        Start with the first sentence. Think about how to express "are at" in Turkish. You can use the verb "to be" in the correct form.
        For the second sentence, use the verb "bırakmak" (to leave) in the correct tense. Consider how to ask a question in Turkish using the verb "görmek" (to see) is not necessary here.
        Don't forget to use the correct suffixes for possession and location.
        Now, try translating the sentences into Turkish. I'll be happy to help you with your attempt!
